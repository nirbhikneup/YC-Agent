# ðŸ¤– GPT Prompt for YC Company AI Explorer

## **Project Description Prompt**

```
I've built a comprehensive YC Company AI Explorer web application that analyzes Y Combinator startup data with AI-powered insights. Here's what it does:

**Core Functionality:**
- Analyzes 40+ YC companies with rich metadata (valuations, employees, industries, contact info)
- Provides AI-powered market analysis, investment recommendations, and industry trends
- Features interactive data exploration with advanced filtering and search
- Includes email extraction and contact analysis for business development
- Offers multiple export formats (CSV, JSON) for data analysis

**Technical Stack:**
- Backend: Python, Playwright (web scraping), BeautifulSoup (HTML parsing), Pandas (data processing)
- Frontend: Streamlit (interactive web app), Custom CSS (gradient designs, animations)
- AI: Simulated Llama 3.1 8B responses for market insights and recommendations
- Deployment: Streamlit Community Cloud with GitHub integration
- Data: SQLite database with CSV export capabilities

**Key Features:**
1. **AI Analysis Tab**: Market insights, investment recommendations, industry trends, company insights
2. **Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time metrics, dynamic charts, smart recommendations
3. **Data Exploration**: Multi-dimensional filtering by batch, industry, email count, valuation
4. **Email Analysis**: Contact extraction, email validation, partnership opportunity identification
5. **Export System**: Filtered downloads in multiple formats with custom column selection

**Business Value:**
- For Investors: Market analysis, trend identification, investment opportunity discovery
- For Entrepreneurs: Competitive analysis, market research, partnership identification
- For Recruiters: Talent acquisition, market intelligence, business development

**Live Demo**: https://yc-agent-findjobs.streamlit.app/

This demonstrates full-stack development, AI integration, data engineering, and cloud deployment - perfect for SWE intern resume screenings.

Can you help me improve this project or suggest additional features that would make it even more impressive for software engineering internships?
