## Quick Fix for Streamlit Access Issues

### Method 1: Fix GitHub Access
1. **Verify Repository Access:**
   - Go to: https://github.com/nirbhikneup/YC-Agent
   - Make sure you're logged in as `nirbhikneup`
   - Ensure repository is **Public**

2. **Fix Streamlit Account:**
   - Go to: https://share.streamlit.io
   - Sign out completely
   - Sign in with GitHub account `nirbhikneup`
   - Try deploying again

### Method 2: Create New Repository
If you want to use a different GitHub account:

1. **Create new repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository
   - Name it `yc-agent` or similar

2. **Update remote URL:**
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. **Deploy to Streamlit:**
   - Use the new repository URL

### Method 3: Manual Upload
If GitHub access is still problematic:

1. **Download the files:**
   - Download `streamlit_simple.py`
   - Download `requirements.txt`
   - Download `yc_companies_Summer_2024.csv`

2. **Create new Streamlit app:**
   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io
   - Click "New app"
   - Choose "Upload files" instead of GitHub
   - Upload the three files

### Method 4: Local Testing First
Test the app locally before deploying:

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas
   ```

2. **Run locally:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_simple.py
   ```

3. **Verify it works:**
   - Open http://localhost:8501
   - Test all features

## ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Next Steps

1. **Try Method 1 first** (fix GitHub access)
2. **If that fails, try Method 2** (new repository)
3. **Test locally with Method 4** to ensure everything works
4. **Then deploy with Method 3** if needed

## ðŸ“ž Need Help?

If you're still having issues:
1. Check your GitHub repository permissions
2. Verify your Streamlit account is linked to the right GitHub account
3. Make sure the repository is public
4. Try creating a fresh repository with a different name
